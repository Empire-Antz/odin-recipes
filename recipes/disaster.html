      poor hygine and lack of common sense is all you need for this recipe
    </h2>
    <p>
      I recently read an article about someone who died 10 hours after eating 5
      day old pasta they had meal prepped and left sitting at room temperature.
      That prompted this recipe of <strong>DO</strong>s and
      <strong>DONT</strong>s to cook up disaster.
    </p>
    <h3>DO</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eat 5 day old pasta that's been kept at room temperature...</li>
      <li>
        Accept random mushrooms from a sketchy stranger at a festival... what
        could go wrong
      </li>
      <li>
        Eat random things you off a busy NYC sidewalk-- New yorkers are tough
        for a reason
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DON'T</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash your hands before or after cooking, or ever...</li>
      <li>
        Store foods in the refrigerator--our ancestors didn't need that shit
      </li>
      <li>pay attention to experation dates, or traffic, or your girlfriend</li>
    </ol>
