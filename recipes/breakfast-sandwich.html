      <li>

      <li>use the bacon grease to cook some sunny side up eggs</li>
      <li>season them obviously-- salt, pepper, garlic, etc...</li>
      <li>
        spoon some bacon grease on top of the eggs to help the top cook a little
        better-- don't want them too runny
      </li>
      <li>
        add half a slice of cheese on top of the egg-- let it melt a little
      </li>
      <li>
        prep the bread with a slice of cheese, when the eggs are done, place on
        top, add bacon slices, top it off with another slice of cheese and bread
      </li>
      <li>
        use a grill press to get your sandwich nice and toasty--don't press too,
        hard too soon-- this is optional but also
        <strong>very important.</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
